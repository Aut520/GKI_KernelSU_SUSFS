//! `/sys/block/zram0/idle` marks idle pages based on boottime clock timestamp which keeps ticking
//! even while the device is suspended. This can end up marking relatively new pages as idle. For
//! example, when the threshold for idle page is 25 hours and the user suspends the device whole the
//! weekend (i.e. 2days), all pages in zram are marked as idle which is too aggressive.
//!
//! [SuspendHistory] mitigates the issue by adjusting the idle threshold by the actual duration of
//! the device is suspended because fixing the kernel to use monotonic clock instead of boottime
//! clock can break existing user space behavior.
//!
//! In this module, we don't use [std::time::Instant] because the Rust standard
//! library used in Android uses [libc::CLOCK_BOOTTIME] while the official Rust
//! standard library implementation uses [libc::CLOCK_MONOTONIC].
